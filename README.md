# Natural Language Processing: DIY

Implement well-known NLP models by myself.

All implementations are in PyTorch and/or Tensorflow.

* `PyTorch_basics`: essential part of PyTorch
* `NLP_with_PyTorch`
    * `1_basics_(tutorial)`: Basic ideas and introduction to NLP. Contents from PyTorch tutorials.
    * `2_word_embedding`: Word embedding models. Contents mainly from research articles and Lee (2019)[^1]
    * `3_document-embedding`: Sentence/document-level embedding models. Contents mainly from research articles and Lee (2019)[^1]
    * `4_sentiment_analysis`: TBD.
* `NLP_with_TensorFlow`: tensorflow port of `NLP_with_PyTorch`
